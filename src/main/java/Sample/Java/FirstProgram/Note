Object − Objects have states and behaviors.
Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behavior such as wagging their tail,
barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.

Class − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type supports.

Methods − A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.

Instance Variables − Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.
