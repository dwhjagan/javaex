Constructor is a block of code that allows you to create an object of class.
This can also be called creating an instance. Constructor looks like a method
but it’s not, for example methods can have any return type or no return type
(considered as void) but constructors don’t have any return type not even void.
There are several other differences between them, we will discuss them in detail
at the end of this article.

Types of Constructors
There are three types of constructors: default, no-arg and parameterised.
